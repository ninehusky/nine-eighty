An Intel 8080 emulator in Java!

Right now, the plan is to implement the 8080's instruction set. Unit tests and interactive debuggers are also likely!

I'm also thinking of being really modular with this; I want to reuse several interfaces/modules in a future emulator.

Another end goal is also to have a pretty nifty gui to play Space Invaders.
